Task:
You will receive JSON data for one football match. Predict the Over/Under 2.5 Goals market using the rules below.

1. prediction: "Over" or "Under"
2. confidence: Weighted score from the table below
3. implied_odds_pct = (1 / odds) × 100
4. edge = confidence% − implied_odds_pct
5. po_value = true if edge > 0, else false
6. Only consider bets if odds are between 1.60 and 1.90 inclusive
7. bankroll_pct (Kelly stake %) = (((confidence_decimal × odds − 1) / (odds − 1)) / 8) × 100
8. Do not recommend if bankroll_pct > 5% or odds outside range
9. rationale = one short reason (max 6 words)
